###Thesis
<strong>Biggest challenge for multitouch blog (shortform) reader apps is that they ignore often desired features found in dedicated longform devices such as e-readers and paper books. This means that current apps fail to fully utilize touch gestures, opting to recycle point and click interaction found in their web-based counterparts rather than capitalizing on similar dynamic touch interaction found in books and e-readers. 

Current blog apps are point and click, we need to take those same core features included in those apps (Feedly, Flipboard, Newsify) and adapt/repurpose them to better fit multitouch. We can easily figure out the best way to alter these features by looking at books and e-readers, seeing what works and what doesn’t.</strong>

###Todo
######Tentative structure:
Create list of core features in current MT app blog readers. Are these really just a recycling of their web based counterparts? Compare this list to the same features in books and e-readers, this will give us insight on how to alter the interaction style of the first list to better represent multitouch.


######Section assingments:

1. Abstract + Introduction (State the problem, views, how we propose to solve)
2. Design Implimentations (Feature by Feature, adapting to multitouch) (accompanied by mockups of layout and specific features)**What the feature is, why is it a challenge to impliment this initially, how did we solve this**
3. Usage Scenarios
4. Design Justifications (Here's how we repurposed the features, here's how they solve the shortform/longform, web/multitouch, dedicated device/non-dedicated, "good ol' books"/damn computer screens divides.) **Why the feature is better than the inital implimentation due in terms of the chosen design style, use examples**
5.  Usability Measurements

J: 1,2 w/ mockups & 4

W: 3,5, LaTEX: Insert pics, review citations/bibliography

#####Misc:
Willy, get the Mou app to edit markdown, or however you prefer. We'll smash it into LaTEX for the final draft.
As much as I hate intext citations over footnotes, just use them for now.

###Brainstorm
Harper Lee, Stephen King, David Foster Wallace: rejecting electronic reading, e-readers. Why?

For example, switching articles - touch an arrow button NEEDS TO BE swipe sideways.

remedied by multitouch blog reader, pleasure of reading longform with out a dedicated, alien device (books don’t have buttons)

functionality of books & ereaders, in comparison with existing multitouch blog readers

blog readers = rss, blog and news

Taking the static interaction features of web blog readers, and the reasons for the rejection of e-readers. (What do we do with those static blog readers, what do we do with books, (repurposing these functions) how do these relate to current multitouch blog readers, and how can we utilize them)

- Make sure to support the claims of difficulties/mismatches with current e-reader technologies with references from the literature.  I'm not sure what you'll find, but make a good-faith effort to see this.

- Make sure to concentrate on the *user interface* rather than functionality.  This can be tricky, because sometimes new features a natural side effect of defining a new user interface.  One way to separate this is to consider whether a given function (e.g., searching for a blog; switching between different posts; etc.) is already available on a different application.  If you are not expanding that function but merely changing *how* that function is presented and interacted with, then you are in safe territory.  If you start envisioning the user doing something that cannot be done in an existing app today, then you are beginning to cross the line into functionality (utility) and we don't want to do too much of that.

### RPG Front-End

___
Built in Backbone.Marionette, boilerplate built alongside chapter by chapter reading from David Sulc's "Backbone Marionette: A Gentle Introduction"

Boilerplate was first modified heavily to communicate with RESTful backend instead of local storage. My choice to leave variable names and many
conventions used by Sulc in the code was deliberate. I am just beginning to grasp the concepts behind web 
applications and MVC, so I trust that Sulc was teaching "best practices". I have no illusions about Sulc's app being similar, but I took this project as an opportunity to expand upon the boilerplate and "flex" my Backbone
skills. On even a cursory look through my code, you will see frequent modifications, comments and attempts to modify Sulc, sometimes incorrectly straying from MVC. I frequently referred to Andy Osmani's "Developing Backbone.js Applications" as well as various "full-stack"
JS examples like Krol's "Contacts App" and Coenraets's "Wine Cellar App". My IxD goals were: non-repetition of features (Sulc had button-palooza),
single-page, MVC (to *think* this way), solid indication of interaction with the Back-End, and minimal but communicative design.

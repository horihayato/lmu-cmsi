###Course Summary
I dedicated the majority of my time during the semester to the "Mind" and "Computation" portions of my proposed study. Computation was addressed in my self study of web application paradigms and technologies. I was able to learn MVC and Backbone.Marionette though constructing David Sulc's "Contact Manager" with the aid of his book "Backbone Marionette: A Gentle Introduction". I then proceeded to adapt the contact manager into a RESTful "full-stack" web app using Node, Express and MongoDB. During my study of metacognition and with my new knowledge of web applications, I was able to implement the timeline and metric views of the "Skillgenie" app by gutting and modifying Sulc's app.

The focus of my research was "Mind". To conclude the study, I produced a "proof of concept" web application in conjunction with research in the philosophy of science and metacognition. My guiding research questions are represented in the following progression of ideas:

+ Can we reduce the theories of cognition? We cannot measure if we cannot reduce. 

+ We are warranted in attempting measurement, measurement has meaning. Do we actually do this? Or is it just philosophical conjecture?
+ Cognitive measurement (specifically metacognitive) actually takes place in psychology, neurobiology and computer science. Although, this information concerning one’s own cognition is not readily accessible to the layperson... Can we make it so?
+ Concluding in: an exercise in metacognition, measuring and presenting data about one’s own cognitive processes.
In regards to Skillgenie, I found that metacognitive measurement could be made accessible for the layperson in examining the "rapid learning" process of certain authors in regards to common skills. Taking this personal interest of mine and attempting to fill in gaps and uncertainties with a sort of "forced introspection" in Skillgenie, concluded in an interesting, promising and useful application of my new knowledge.
I addressed the "Logic" portion through a weekly review of predicate logic, taking problem sets that mirrored my course in symbolic logic. Although I did not get to apply any new information, I felt that the review was helpful in "keeping up" my proof skills. Additionally, during the time that I set aside each week (during the often silent ARC Writing Tutoring hours at the library), I was able to tutor my co-worker in their symbolic logic course.

Skillgenie is a platform that facilitates an independent education, completely apart from the specifics of the information. At its core, the app creates a habitual feedback loop for learning in one system, by one person. Skillgenie is designed to record oneâ€™s applications of their self-learning (currently skewed towards actionable skills like golf or chess) and create friendly visualizations, give helpful tips (in an effort to enforce and inspire self-correction) and link to a community, all while seeking to further the user's ability to gather, retain and use any information.

Application based off of David Sulc's Backbone.Marionette series of instructional material and Jason Krol's "BENM" boilerplate.
